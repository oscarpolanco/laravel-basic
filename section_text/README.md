# Laravel Basic

## Section 1: Introduction

`Laravel` is a framework for create sides using `PHP` that works well with `MySQL` database. It have a couple of pre-package feauters that are very useful like the following:

- [blade](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/blade) - That is a template engine that will help us to build dynamic html sites.
- [auth](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/authentication#introduction) - Came with an authentication system.
- [eloquent](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/eloquent) - Is an [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) that will help us to query the database.

Use a `MVC` parttern to structure it code so we will have a representation of some information on the database in the `model`; the `view` that is a template that we send to the browser and a `controller` that get information of the `model` and inject that to the `view`.
